# Lazy Agent - Terminal Environment for AI Agents

Like LazyVim, but for terminal-based AI agent workflows. Get a beautiful, productive terminal setup in minutes.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Claude Code** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/runpod/lazy-agent.git
   cd lazy-agent
   ```

3. **Run the setup wizard**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   # Edit config.json with your name and preferences
   ```

4. **Run Claude Code and say**: "help me get started"

Claude will read your config and guide you through a personalized setup.

## Learning Tmux

Claude teaches you tmux interactively - no separate tutorial needed. Just say:

There's also a printable cheatsheet at `reference/tmux-cheatsheet.html`.

## Need Help?

Just ask Claude! That's the whole point.

If Claude Code isn't installed yet, you can:
- Follow the steps manually in `steps/` directory
- Check out the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)

## Check Your Setup

See what's installed and what's missing:

```bash
./doctor.sh
```

## Updating

Pull the latest changes and update your configs:

```bash
./update.sh
```

This will:
- Pull latest from the repo
- Show what changed
- Optionally re-install dotfiles if they were updated

## Contributing

PRs welcome! This is meant to evolve as the tools change.

## Philosophy

Like LazyVim, we believe:
- **Sensible defaults** - Works out of the box
- **Opinionated but configurable** - We made choices, but you can change them
- **Self-contained** - One repo, everything you need
- **Evolvable** - The tools change, so should this
